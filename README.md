I start my trip of IT I through games.I will never forget how excited I am when I find a sony ps1 in a locker.Although it is full of dust, I took it out and try to make it work.And then its owner(who is also my father) came with a big smile.We spent our whole afternoon on it.My interest was only limited to the games.When I saw my father’s iphone 3G, it really blew up my mind.As it was the first touch screen phone I had ever seen then.Its appearance and the way to operate was totally different from other mobile phones.It was convenient to operate by fingers and its appearance is elegant and minimalist I thought.I believed that I saw the future.Since then, I became a fan of apple and Steve Jobs.Designing and producing a product like iphone became one of my dreams.Steve Jobs’ experience and words inspire me a lot and lead me to the IT.

These tests help me know myself better.My personality, my daily behaviors, my style of studying.The results can be the guidance of my behavior to some degree.Although there are some points in the result are against the fact, I could think about the reasons and learn more about myself and other people.

I usually tend to play a role that is not what I am good at and do something that is actually beyond my ability which harm my performance in the team. I should think about what is the best role I can play in a team combined with the test results which is helpful to be active and fit well in a team.Thus, I would change my behaviour according to the test results to see the benefits.
   
When forming a team, I will keep the diversity and try not to bring in too much disagreements and conflicts.The team members should be able to cooperate with each other well but not lacking the creativity.I will take members’ ability, personality and other features into consideration when assigning tasks and also respect their will.


### Project ideas
I want to develop an app that uses AI to diagnose patients at any time and any place, which support both android and ios.AI in the app will ask users questions to assess the users’ health status.AI will also be able to record users’ medical data and help doctors to make right diagnosis.At the early stage the AI’s misdiagnosis rate may not be satisfied.So the diagnosis report produced by AI will only used for reference.And users can connect with doctors for further diagnosis and get treated.

People may meet problems when seeking medical help, such as hard to make an appointment, too much waiting time and difficult to meet with specialist when needed.Thus, it is easy for people to miss the best time to treat their disease with no timely diagnosis.As for those outpatient, they may face the problem of misdiagnosis.When misdiagnosis happens, the wrong measures taken could harm patients health heavily.By using this app, I hope that misdiagnosis rate can be reduced to minimum and people will get timely diagnosed and treated with relatively low expenses.

The core of the app is an AI chat robot which can produce a diagnosis report by talking with users.As the status can be complex and multiple of symptoms can be promiscuous, the report will contain several possibilities of what the diseases are.Another important function is that users are able to connect with doctors online for further diagnosis.In this case, the report produced by AI will also be used for reference.When medicine needed, users can use our medicine delivery service.It will ensure that users can receive medicine from the closest pharmacy in a short time.When the users’ status are dangerous and need emergency treatment, calling an ambulance with this app and a doctor will be online to guide if first-aid treatment was needed.Then ambulance will pick the patient up with the positioning service in this app. This app also has the potential to be part of the remote medical system.

Cloud technology, AI technology, database technology and positioning technology are required.
Server, computer, SDK are required.

If the project is successful, it will be able to fit in the hospital system to provide high-quality medical service covering a wide area.And users can be diagnosed in a high successful rate and get treated timely with low expenses.As a result, the mecical system was improved and the medical expense for both government and individual will be reduced.
